# Performance Optimizations

This document outlines the performance optimizations implemented to improve site loading speed and reduce lag.

## Video Optimizations

### 1. Intersection Observer

- **Problem**: Video was playing immediately on page load, causing lag
- **Solution**: Implemented Intersection Observer to only play video when it's actually visible in the viewport
- **Benefits**:
  - Reduces initial page load time
  - Saves bandwidth and battery on mobile devices
  - Improves user experience

### 2. Lazy Loading

- **Problem**: Video was loading immediately even if not visible
- **Solution**: Video only loads when it comes into view
- **Implementation**:
  - Video source is only added when `isVideoLoaded` state is true
  - Intersection Observer triggers video loading when 50% visible

### 3. Preload Optimization

- **Problem**: Video was preloading the entire file
- **Solution**: Set `preload="metadata"` to only load video metadata initially
- **Benefits**: Faster initial page load, video loads only when needed

## Image Optimizations

### 1. Next.js Image Component

- **Problem**: Standard `<img>` tags don't provide automatic optimization
- **Solution**: Replaced all `<img>` tags with Next.js `<Image>` component
- **Benefits**:
  - Automatic WebP/AVIF format serving
  - Responsive image loading
  - Lazy loading by default
  - Automatic size optimization

### 2. Responsive Images

- **Implementation**: Added proper `sizes` attribute to all images
- **Benefits**:
  - Serves appropriately sized images for different screen sizes
  - Reduces bandwidth usage on mobile devices
  - Improves loading speed

### 3. Image Optimization Script

- **Location**: `scripts/optimize-images.js`
- **Usage**: `npm run optimize-images`
- **Features**:
  - Converts JPG/PNG to WebP format
  - Resizes images to maximum 1920px width
  - Maintains quality at 85%
  - Provides file size comparison

## Configuration Changes

### Next.js Config

- **Enabled**: Image optimization (was previously disabled)
- **Added**: WebP and AVIF format support
- **Configured**: Responsive breakpoints and cache settings

## Usage Instructions

### Running Image Optimization

```bash
npm run optimize-images
```

This will:

1. Scan all images in the `public` directory
2. Create optimized versions in `public/optimized`
3. Convert JPG/PNG to WebP format
4. Resize oversized images
5. Show file size savings

### After Optimization

1. Review the optimized images in `public/optimized`
2. Replace original images with optimized versions
3. Update image paths in code if needed (WebP extensions)

## Performance Impact

### Expected Improvements

- **Initial Page Load**: 40-60% faster
- **Video Performance**: No lag when video comes into view
- **Image Loading**: 30-50% smaller file sizes
- **Mobile Performance**: Significantly improved due to responsive images

### Monitoring

- Use browser DevTools to measure performance improvements
- Check Network tab for reduced file sizes
- Monitor Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS)

## Future Optimizations

### Additional Improvements

1. **CDN Integration**: Consider using a CDN for static assets
2. **Video Compression**: Further compress video files if needed
3. **Critical CSS**: Inline critical CSS for above-the-fold content
4. **Service Worker**: Implement caching strategy for repeat visits
5. **Image Sprites**: Combine small icons into sprite sheets

### Monitoring Tools

- Google PageSpeed Insights
- WebPageTest.org
- Chrome DevTools Lighthouse
- GTmetrix
