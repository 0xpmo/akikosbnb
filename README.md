## üåø The Spirit of This Place

> "Our deep love for Hawaii flows through every moment here‚Äîits beauty, its human naturalness, its modesty and magnificent contrasts. Yin and yang dance together: the dynamic interplay of soft and hard, cold and hot, silky and bumpy, modest and wild. Here you'll find both yoga and zazen stillness, the rhythm of older Hawaii‚Äîslower, more humane."
